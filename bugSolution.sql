To avoid implicit type conversion errors, always ensure that you compare values of the same data type.  Explicitly convert values to the desired type using functions like `CAST` or `CONVERT`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR(10)) = '123';
```

The above SQL query explicitly converts the `employee_id` column to a VARCHAR before comparing it to the string '123'.

For handling NULL values correctly, consistently use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators to check for the presence or absence of NULL values, instead of using the equality operator (`=`).

```sql
-- Correct: Checks for NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id IS NULL;

-- Correct: Checks for non-NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id IS NOT NULL;
```
Always validate data types and carefully handle NULL values to prevent these errors in your SQL queries.
